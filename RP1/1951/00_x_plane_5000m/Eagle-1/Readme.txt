The plane has flaps and spoilers.

To take off, set flaps to "take-off" by pressing "9" twice. Roll only after 80m/s with small pitch-up, until the plane natually take off, do not force a take off, otherwise, it will stall.
To land, the plane can land at speed of 65 m/s, and 75 m/s to be safe with flaps set to "landing" by pressing "9".
